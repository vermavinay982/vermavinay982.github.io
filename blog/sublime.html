<h1>Installing Sublime in Ubuntu 20.04</h1>

<p>Process if installing is very tedius but I have compiled all the steps that can be used to install sublime in your linux system.</p>
<p>The Key method was not working for me so I tried other method and in the end I want the signature "subl" in sublime text to use directly in my termial.</p>

<p>So here you go! </p>

<pre>
  <code>
Download tarball as per 64 or 32 bit from here- 
        https://www.sublimetext.com/3
		
Go to download folder and extract zip
        tar vxjf sublime_text_3_build_3211_x64.tar.bz2
        
Move extracted binaries to opt
        sudo mv sublime_text_3 /opt/
        
        
        sudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text_3/sublime_text /usr/bin/sublime
        
Test if its working
        sublime

Optional - if you want to have subl alias to open sublime then
        
open bashrc
        sublime ~./bashrc
		
Add this line in the end
	alias subl=sublime
        
Source bashrc to update changes
        source ~/.bashrc
        
Test now it should work
        subl 

Done
